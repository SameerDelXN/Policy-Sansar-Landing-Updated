            In accordance with IRDAI rules and regulations, you have the right
            to cancel your insurance policy within 15 (fifteen) days from the
            date of (online) receipt of the policy (referred to as the "Free
            Look Period"). A refund of your premium amount will be processed
            following the procedures applicable by the insurer. The Free Look
            facility is available only for Life and Health insurance policies,
            subject to specific terms and conditions outlined by IRDAI. We
            recommend all customers carefully review the insurance policy
            document and utilize the Free Look facility if the terms and
            conditions do not align with your insurance requirements. Please
            note that once a cancellation request is placed within the Free Look
            Period, the policy will be canceled, and the full premium will be
            refunded to you, subject to the following deductions:
